   *
   * Be able to answer the following questions: Does the stack grow up or down? 
   * Does ucontext_t.uc_stack point to the current stack pointer? Top of the
   * stack? Bottom of the stack? None of the above? What are the stack related 
   * things in mycontext.uc_mcontext.gregs[]? What's the difference between
   * REG_UESP and REG_ESP in the gregs array?
   *
   * Hint: It might help to run the program using gdb or xxx (a graphical
   * front end to gdb) and put a breakpoint at entry to main and/or the 
   * call to getcontext().  Then use "info registers" to see the values 
   * of the registers and use "next"/"step" to advance to the next instruction.
   * You can also use "print mycontext" to see the values stored in that struct.
   *
   * Anther experiment you might try is changing the various candidates for the
   * stack pointer to nonsensical values and (probably using a debugger) see
   * which one actually gets restored to the processor.
   *
   * Don't move on to the next part of the lab until you know how to change
   * the stack in a context when you manipulate a context to create a new thread.
